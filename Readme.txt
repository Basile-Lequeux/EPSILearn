Project description: Revision platform powered by, and for students. Each student can put a course online, classify it in a category, and add a number of questions based on a multiple choice system. Everyone has access to the course, and can try to answer the MCQ provided that it contributes to the enrichment. We must therefore create a new question answer each time we want to take the quiz.
